    <h1> about </h1>
    <p> mostly me writing about stuff i'm working on for future reference. link to my current project's webpage, 
      <a href="yasl.html">YASL</a>.

    <h1> 07/01/2018</h1>
    <p> figured out how to implement nested scopes, will actually implement them soon. i plan on using nested envs while walking 
        the AST to figure out where to store everything in memory at runtime. i'll post a better explanation when i acutally write up
        the code. it's easy to say "i know how to do X", it's another to actually do X. maybe i'm overlooking something. i'll try implementing
        if-statements and while-loops tmr/tonight. once i have those, it'll be easy to do any other kind of loop,  and to extend
        if-statements to if-else-statements and if-elseif-....-elseif-else-statements.
    </p>
    <p> right now i'm doing a bunch of job appls, need something for this summer, so i don't have a lot of spare time. </p>
    <p> implemented lexical scoping and if-statements, after redoing my resume. i think i need to implement assignment before i
        can move on to else statements and loops, otherwise what's the point if i can't assign to global variables inside a local
        scope.
    </p>
    <h1> 06/01/2018 </h1>
    <p> added <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, and <code>&lt;=</code>. i basically reused the same macro as for the 
        binary operators, although i changed it a bit, because i wanted to return a bool, not an int.
    </p>
    <p> added <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code>, which are for value equality. (what i mean by value equality, is (e.g.) two strings
        are value-equal if they contain the same characters, even if they are stored in different spots in memory. i'll clarify more
        when i add operators for reference equality later or when i add more complicated types like strings.) i'll add reference 
        equality later, probably as <code>===</code> and <code>!==</code>.
    </p>
    <p> oh, semantics of value equality: </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>nil</code> compared with anything returns <code>nil</code>.</li>
      <li>ints and floats can be compared with each other and return the expected values. (e.g. <code>1 == 1.0</code> 
          returns <code>true</code>.)</li>
      <li>booleans compared with each other as expected.</li>
      <li>all other comparisons across types return <code>false</code>. (e.g. <code>1 == true</code> 
          returns <code>false</code>.)</li>
    </ul>
    <h1> 05/01/2018 </h1>
    <p> added <code>nil</code> value. </p>
    <p> i figured out how to do if-statements and while-loops, but i need to implement scopes first. </p>
    <p> i implemented the ternary operator (same as C, unless i f*cked something up), using branch if false
        and unconditional branch. 
    </p>
    <p> i decided that <code>false</code> and <code>nil</code> are falsey, and everything else is truthy. this
        seems like the cleanest way to do things. i'm not a big fan of the python way of having the trivial instances of 
        everything (empty string, empty list, empty anything, None, false, 0, etc) be falsey. it just feels like too many.
    </p>
    <p> once i figure out scopes i'll add while-loops and if statements. </p>
    <p> actually, i guess adding <code>!</code>, <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, comparators, etc is probably the next step now that i have 
      the ternary operator and booleans. 
    </p>
    <p> added <code>!</code>, <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>. will work on comparators later. 
        <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> shortcircuit, which took me a while to figure out how to implement
        without adding registers to my VM. long story short, i got it working, but i had to add a "duplicate" instruction
        to the VM, to let me get away with only evaluating the left condition once.
    </p>
    <p> the idea is, push the left side onto the stack, duplicate it, push the size of the right side + 1 onto the stack,
        branch if the left side is truthy (for <code>or</code>) or falsey (for <code>and</code>) 
        (this skips over all the stuff for the right side if we branch), pop top of stack 
        (this gets rid of the second copy of the left side from stack), then push the right side to stack. 
        this is not the best explanation, since i haven't actually explained how my VM or bytecodes actually work, 
        but hopefully it gives an idea.
    </p>
    <p> maybe there's a better way to do this, but nothing comes to mind. </p>
    <p> cleaned up the code for the binary operators a lot by making it into a macro, since it was basically the same for add,
        multiply and subtract.
    </p>

    <p> added booleans. </p>

    <p>
        I've settled in to being quarantined. I'm currently doing well enough in most of my classes that I don't think
        I have to write the finals in order to pass. UBC was quite generous with the changes it made to grading schemes
        this term.
    </p>
    <p>
        All I have is my undergrad thesis, which I'm waaaaaay behind on. Writing shitty blog posts isn't really helping
        me honestly.

        I'm gonna buy some extra RAM for my computer so I can play some games once I've graduated. I've only got 8 GB,
        which is fine for most uses, but honestly for less than $100 I can upgrade, so why not.

        I also plan on picking up some PS4 games, notably
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortal_Kombat_11">MK11</a> and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Fighter_V">SFV</a>. Those should last me a while over the summer.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was thinking of picking up
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering">Magic: The Gathering</a> again as well, while in
        quarantine. I looked at some new cards I could get. Before I knew it I was at $1000 of stuff I wanted to buy.
        Well. I remember why I fucking stopped playing.

        Death toll is at 69k, infections are at 1.2M.
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Johnson">Boris Johnson</a> has been hospitalized as well
        apparently.

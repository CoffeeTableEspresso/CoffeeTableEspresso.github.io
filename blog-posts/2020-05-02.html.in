    <h2><em>Sucker Punch</em></h2>
    <p>
        Anyone else remember <em>Sucker Punch</em>? The incoherent mess from Zack Snyder that your mum wouldn't let you
        watch because it stars a chick in a schoolgirl outfit chopping people up with a katana and whose mum would let
        their child watch that? No? Me neither, until recently, when I stumbled upon it and remembered my pubescent
        desire to watch it. So fuck it, it's quarantine, what else am I gonna do. (Spoiler: <span class="spoiler">It's
        an incoherent mess</span>. Also, spoilers ahead, although it's not like it fucking matters for this movie.)
    </p>
    <h3> Plot (If You Can Even Call It That) </h3>
    <p>
        Calling the movie hard-to-follow is generous. I had to read the plot summary on Wikipedia to make any sense of
        it. Maybe that's the 5 beers I had before watching it though. Honestly. Regardless, the plot is something like this:
        Babydoll's (yes, the fucking main character is named <em>Babydoll</em>) step-father kills her sister and blames
        her for it.
    </p>
    <p>
        He has her sent to the mental hospital, since this is the 1960's (I think?) and you can just do that to women
        apparently. He bribes them to have her lobotomized (in 5 days when the doctor comes back).
    </p>
    <p>
        The main plot takes place inside Babydoll's hallucinations/dreams, which parallel her attempts to escape in the
        real world.
    </p>
    <h3> Watching the Fucking Thing </h3>
    <p>
        As mentioned, this thing is haaaaaaaaaaaard to follow. Having zero explanation for any of it doesn't help.
        The two main dream sequences are one where all the girls are whores at a brothel, and random action sequences
        (during which the girls somehow wear <em>less</em> clothes than when they're supposed to be actual prostitutes,
        which I guess is fitting commentary about Action Girls).
    </p>
    <p>
        Babydoll wears a schoolgirl outfit the entire time for no apparent reason than sEx ApPeaL. All the other
        characters are dressed similarly, again for no reason. I've heard people say that this is done ironically, as a
        critique of geek culture's objectification of women, but just because it's ironic doesn't mean people won't
        jerk off to it unironically.
    </p>
    <p>
        The action scenes are actually pretty great. They're completely separate from the rest of the movie, featuring
        things like Babydoll et al. chopping up undead Germans in World War I (It was made <em>very</em> clear which war
        this was), or Babydoll fighting random giant samurai in feudal Japan. I can't complain about the choreography
        either, everyone involved does a great job.
    </p>
    <p>
        Plotwise, I was genuinely shocked when <span class="spoiler">Amber is abruptly shot in the back of the
        head</span> near the end of the movie. Kudos to them for me not seeing that coming <em>at all</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The ending was too upbeat for my tastes, however. I won't spoil it, but at several points, they had the
        option of going waaaaaaay darker, but backed out at the last minute. "Fucking cowards" is all I'll say.
    </p>
    <h3> Closing Thoughts </h3>
    <p>
        This movie is like someone took every criticism of geek culture they could find and put it all into one movie.
        Women in skimpy, borderline fetishistic, outfits? Check. Over the top fight scenes every 5 minutes for no
        reason other than that they look cool? Check. Weird Revenge Fantasy? Check. Incoherent plot that's just an
        excuse for all of the above? Check.
    </p>
    <p>
        It almost feels like watching someone's weird fetish dream for 2 hours, which is a little uncomfortable but
        not really <em>that</em> uncomfortable since it's a pretty cool dream. It's hard to believe this is a
        real movie and not some elaborate parody honestly.
    </p>
    <p>
        Despite all the above, I deeply enjoyed it anyways. It's so over the top it's hard to take seriously, but it's
        very <em>very</em> fun to watch after fucking figuring out the incoherent mess of the plot. By the end of it I
        actually cared whether their nonsense plan was gonna come together, which is more than I can say of most
        movies I watch. It's like, so shitty that it loops back around to being good again.
    </p>
    <p><em>Sucker Punch</em> is a true work of art. </p>

        I was going to do a serious post about the coronavirus, but thought better of it. Here's a shitpost instead.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've been quarantined for only a week at this point and I already feel like I'm going fucking nuts.
    </p>
    <p>
        I had to cancel my planned trip for this summer, obviously. I still have a job lined up in the fall though.
        I guess being able to work completely remotely is a blessing that most people don't have.
    </p>
    <p>
        I swear to fucking god though, I'm gonna go crazy if I'm trapped inside with nothing to do all summer. At least
        right now I have school to finish.

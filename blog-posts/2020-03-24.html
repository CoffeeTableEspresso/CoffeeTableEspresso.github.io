        Yesterday, UBC announced that we could change courses to pass or fail grading <em>after</em> getting our final
        grades.

        I have since lost what little motivation I had left for school.

        The repercussions of this go beyond just the deaths from the virus itself though. Anyone else who gets sick
        while the hospitals are full isn't going to be able to get proper medical attention, which will further add to
        the deaths.

        Add to that a possible recession, because of the sudden shut down caused by the virus. Hooray.

        Lastly, the effects on privacy. While using cellphone data to track infected people's movements might seem like
        a good idea now, it's a slippery slope to just constantly tracking everyone. Big Brother is watching.

        is offering free premium memberships during the quarantine, so that's something.

    <h2> SemVer is a Lie (or: <em>Everything</em> is your API) </h2>
    <p>
        Semantic Versioning (SemVer) is great in practice. Increment the patch number for bug fixes, the minor number
        for backwards-compatible new features, and the major version for breaking changes. Any internal changes not
        visible to the users can be changed whenever, as long as the API stays the same. Sounds great in practice.
        And works well enough in the real world. Most of the time. There's just a few caveats to be aware of
        when actually applying it.
    </p>
    <h3> Users Don't Give a Shit About Anything Except Whether it Just Works </h3>
    <p>
        I know, should be pretty obvious right? If people are using my library (for example), and it breaks, it doesn't
        matter if I fixed an old bug, introduced a new bug, changed something that's not part of the API, or made a
        breaking change. <em>I still broke things for my users.</em> Let me repeat that. <em> It doesn't matter what
        change I made if it breaks things for my users.</em> Once your library is big enough, <em>every observable
        behaviour</em> is going to be relied on by someone, and changing any observable behaviour <em>will break
        someone's code</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        As an example, consider
        <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/v8/issues/detail?id=164">this "bug" report from 2008</a>, about the V8
        changing their JavaScript implementation to no longer keep track of the insertion order of keys in
        <code>Object</code>s. Nowhere in the ECMAScript standard did it say that <code>Object</code>s should keep track
        of insertion order. In fact, it specifically mentioned that <code>Object</code>s do not. The change the V8 team
        should have been totally fine. They didn't change any behaviour that was part of the ECMAScript standard.
        <code>Object</code>s keeping track of insertion order was an implementation detail.
    </p>
    <p>
        And yet, as the bug report above shows, people <em>did</em> rely on it. They relied on it to the point that V8
        changed things back, and this behaviour ended up being added to the ECMAScript standard. Because while it
        wasn't technically part of the API, people <em>could</em> rely on it, so they inevitably did.
    </p>
    <p>
        As another example, I did a co-op at a game's company once. My team worked on a library for network code (among
        other things). It was half a million LOC, written over 15 years, and with random contributions from random
        game devs.
    </p>
    <p>
        In short, it was full to the brim with tech debt. In particular, we weren't consistent in our use of host- and
        network-order throughout our code. This wasn't part of the API, just implementation details. Users of our
        library shouldn't have even known about this, let alone relied on it.
    </p>
    <p>
        So we decided to clean up this piece of tech debt. We made everything use host-order, and it was beautiful. Our
        tech debt was fixed, all without affecting our users.
    </p>
    <p>
        This lasts for about a day, until everything came crashing down. Turns out some users had hard-coded values in
        certain places in ways they shouldn't have, and us changing the order had completely broken all of their code.
        Doesn't matter that they were completely misusing our API, and shouldn't have even hardcoded those kinds of
        values in the first place.
    </p>
    <p>
        We promptly rolled things back.
    </p>
    <h3> Conclusion </h3>
    <p>
        Is V8 wrong for changing implementation details of <code>Object</code>s in a way that's totally acceptable
        according to the ECMAScript Standard? Are people wrong for relying on this behaviour even though they were
        repeatedly warned not to?
    </p>
    <p>
        Were we wrong to try to clean up tech debt? Were our users wrong to hardcode values like they did?
    </p>
    <p>
        In the end, it doesn't even matter. What matters is that the changes broke <em>a lot</em> of people's code.
        It's pointless to argue who is "right" or "wrong" here.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a library author, it's your responsibility to avoid breaking people's code with your updates. If people are
        relying on something, even if it's not technically part of your API, people will be upset over you changing it.
        Be careful when writing your library, and when making changes to it.
    </p>
    <p> Just because it's not part of your API doesn't mean people won't treat it like it is. </p>

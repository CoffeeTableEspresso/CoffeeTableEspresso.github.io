        We're close to a million coronavirus cases worldwide now (928 thousand currently). Things are starting to look
        bad in the states. Italy and Spain continue to be in rough shape.

        UBC has announced changes to grading: my final exams are worth either 5% or 30%, whichever would give me a higher

        makes school pretty much pointless.

  <h2> Why Little Endian is More Natural (or: English Does Numbers Wrong) </h2>
  <p>People often treat big endian as if it's more natural than little endian because English (more of less) uses a big endian
    system. Putting aside the fact that just because English does something doesn't make it more natural, let's look at
    <em>why</em> English uses a big endian system.
  </p>
  <h3>Brief History of Numbers in English</h3>
  <p>Modern English got its numerals from Arabic. Numbers are represented the same in Arabic and Egnlish (i.e. "102" represents
    one hundred and two in both English and Arabic). The interesting part of this is that Arabic is read right-to-left instead
    of
    left-to-right, meaning that Arabic used a little-endian system (since they'd start reading "102" from the right, which is
    the
    small side). When English speakers borrowed this, we left it "as is", which gave us the big-endian system we use today.
  </p>
  <h3>Was English Always Big-Endian?</h3>
  <p>But this doesn't say anything about whether English was little- or big-endian before it borrowed numerals from Arabic.
    However, the evidence seems to suggest English used to be little-endian, and it was only the use of Arabic numerals that
    switched us to big-endian. Where is this evidence? Right under our noses, in words like "nineteen" (or, "nine ten", before
    we corrupted the pronunciation). Most Germanic languages (the family of languages most closely related to English) besides
    English actually go a step further than English in this regard: In German, for example "121" is "einhunderteinundzwanzig"
    ("ein-hundert ein und zwanzig", if we put spaces between the words), or "one hundred one and twenty" if we translate
    literally. In other words, the 10s and 1s columns are "flipped" with regards to how it's written. Why? For the same reason
    English says "nineteen": it's leftover from when German also used a little-endian system.
  </p>
  <h3>But Why Would Little-Endian Be More Natural?</h3>
  <p>There's two reasons to prefere a little-endian system over a big-endian one for natural language. Firstly, When doing
    addition, we start at the small end of the number (because we need to carry), so in English we end up reading
    right-to-left when doing math, and left-to-right in other cases. Second, when reading a number out loud, we first have to
    count the digits. Try reading "1 234 567" out loud: the first thing you did was count the number of digits so you knew
    what column the "1" was in. If we wrote our numbers in a little-endian way, this wouldn't be an issue: simply start
    reading; the first digit is always the 1s column, so there's no need to even count the number of digits.
  </p>
  <h3>So Should We Switch to a Little-Endian System?</h3>
  <p>No. Absolutely not. If we were to start from scratch, I'd definitely prefer it, but since we are all already used to
    the current system, it would be much too difficult to switch. Imagine reading a book and being unable to tell what a number
    is without checking the publication date (since you can't tell if the number is big- or little-endian without knowing if
    it was published before or after we all switched endianness).
  </p>
  <h3>So What Was the Point of This Post?</h3>
  <p>I didn't really have a point to make here, just some cool history I stumbled across. And I wanted to ruin numbers for
    all of you like they are now ruined for me.

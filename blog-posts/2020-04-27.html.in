    <p> I finished the last of my exams a few days ago. </p>
    <p>
        I just have my undergrad thesis left. Once I'm done that, I'll be done school forever. (Or at
        least my undergrad forever.)
    </p>
    <p>
        It's weird to think about stuff like that. I've spent most of my life in some sort of school, now I'm done.
    </p>
    <p>
        At least I'll have some time during the summer to work on <a href="https://github.com/yasl-lang/yasl">YASL</a>.

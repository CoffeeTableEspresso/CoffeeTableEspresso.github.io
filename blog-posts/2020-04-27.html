    <p> I finished the last of my exams a few days ago. </p>
    <p>
        I just have my undergrad thesis left. Once I'm done that, I'll be done school forever. (Or at
        least my undergrad forever.)
    </p>
    <p>
        It's weird to think about stuff like that. I've spent most of my life in some sort of school, now I'm done.

        At least I'll have some time during the summer to work on <a href="https://github.com/yasl-lang/yasl">YASL</a>.

    <h2> Horror Movies </h2>
    <p>
        I've been watching a bunch of horror movies lately, being in quarantine and all. Most people don't "get"
        horror movies I don't think.
    </p>
    <p>
        Criticisms include "low budget", "predictable", "bad plot". In the end, it doesn't even matter though. None of
        those things make them less enjoyable. I'm not watching horror movies for any of those things. I'm watching
        them to get my heart pumping. To scare myself a little bit.
    </p>
    <p>
        Take <em>Would You Rather</em> for example. 5 Minutes in, Blonde's brother is "quite sick".
        Doctor suggests a "game", where the "winner" would be "taken care of" (i.e. get her brother the bone marrow
        transplant he needs). Already, it's quite predictable where this is going. And yet, it doesn't matter.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've known the brother for 10 minutes. He's played by a terrible actor, as is his sister. I know almost nothing
        about him or his disease. I don't care about him in the slightest. I'm here to watch his sister play Would You
        Rather with deadly stakes.
    </p>
    <h3> What Makes a Horror Movie "Good"? </h3>
    <p>
        In my opinion, if a horror movie gets your heart pounding, it's "good". In the same way that porn is "good" if
        it gets you hard/wet. Not "good" in any meaningful way, "good" in the sense that they do exactly what they
        were designed for.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this sense, <em>Human Centipede</em> is a "good" movie. Low budget, mostly laughable acting (save the doctor,
        he really sells it), almost no plot save "I want to sew 3 people together for some reason".
    </p>
    <p>
        And yet, it's a terrifying experience. No, it's not "medically possible", but some lunatic could still try it,
        likely killing every link in the centipede along the way.
    </p>
    <h3> Horror Movie Rules </h3>
    <p>
        People seem to by a different set of rules in horror movies. No one in their right mind would split up with
        their friends when lost in the forest in the middle of the night. No one would sleep over at a random strangers
        house in the middle of nowhere. No one ever thinks to phone the police. (This is actually pretty sensible, since
        the police in horror movies are all but useless anyways.)
    </p>
    <p>
        It's within these insane rules that horror movies exist. In this insane dream world. My favourite two plots are
        "rich people torture poor people for their own amusement" and "lone group is picked off one-by-one by a serial
        killer". Both completely insane plots, that <em>could</em> happen in real life but definitely won't.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is part of the fun of horror movies. It's like a dream. Some plot that scares you, but won't ever happen.
        You watch the characters act out the worst possible choices, slowly dying off one-by-one. You know their
        decisions are bad. You can only sit back and watch. You can't change anything. And you don't get to wake up.
    </p>
    <h3> Horror Movies I Actually Like </h3>
    <p>
        <em>Hush</em> is a good one. The setup: A lone, deaf girl in a cabin. A murderer shows up to torment her. She
        eventually outwits and kills him. It's a classic plot really. And yet it works so well.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Escape Room</em> is another personal favourite. Sinister corporation gets people to play a deadly game of
        escape room. Players die off one-by-one. There's a nice plot twist at the end, too.
    </p>
    <h3> Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        Honestly, a post where I openly compare horror movies to porn probably shouldn't be taken too seriously. Just
        like horror movies. They're not meant to be some cinematic masterpiece. They're just about giving you a good
        scare.

    <h2> Internet Explorer Returns! </h2>
    <p>
        Remember the good old days when certain sites only worked in certain browsers? you know, these ones:
    </p>

    <p>
        I sure don't, I'm way too young for that. Nevertheless, lately I've noticed a disturbing trend
        of things not working except in Chrome.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here's a few sites that I've found that are "Chrome-only", in some way:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Collaborate Ultra</b> &mdash; I found students unable to connect if they were on Safari.
        <li><b> Facebook Calls with more than two people</b> &mdash; Really Zuck'? You guys couldn't be
            bothered to make this work on anything except Chrome?
        <li><b>PH_LOGO(Porn,hub)</b> &mdash; This works on my PC but not my laptop. Seriously guys?
            video streaming is supposed to be your thing, this is just laziness.
        <li><b>Airbnb</b> &mdash; <a href="https://twitter.com/jyasskin/status/935173698046214145">This tweet
            by Airbnb</a>, in response to someone saying their site wasn't working properly on Safari.
    </ul>
    <p>
        All the complaints I've heard of how bad the web used to be when people made a site only for IE,
        or only for Navigator. And yet here we are in 2020, doing <em>the exact same shit</em>.
        Wonderful. Great work everyone.
    </p>
    <h2> Why Is This a Problem? </h2>
    <p>
        The arguments against just using Chrome are not for technical reasons. Chrome works very,
        very well. Just as well, if not better, than any other browser.
    </p>
    <p>
        The arguments against Chrome are based on wanting a free and open web. Chrome having a monopoly is
        bad for that. Just look at:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Chrome working to disable ad-blockers;
        <li> Chrome removing ads from people other than Google;
        <li> Chrome influencing web standards since they're the <em>de facto</em> standard.
    </ul>
    <p>
        Can you really sit here and argue that any of the above are actually good?
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course not. The above are good <em>for Google</em>, and <em>only</em> for Google.
    </p>
    <h2> What If This is Unavoidable? </h2>
    <p>
        What if this is just what happens with web browser? On the developer side, it's certainly easier
        to test in a single browser. On the user side, it's very easy to download a new browser if
        there's a problem with your current one.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you reach a critical mass of users on a browser, it's hard to justify spending lots of
        time (and hence money) making sure things work on every other possible browser you could find.
    </p>
    <p>
        For users, if you find that one browser <em>just works</em> for everything, and another doesn't,
        which are you going to choose? Even if the browsers themselves aren't at fault for this, but the
        developers. End users simply don&apos;t care. They just want to be able to browse PH_LOGO(The,Web)
        without any problems.
    </p>
    <h2> Conclusion </h2>
    <p> We need to do better with making sure sites run perfectly <em>in all browsers</em>.</p>
    <p>
        And failing that, we need more regulation for tech monopolies. Having a single company
        in charge of the future of the Internet doesn't seem like such a good idea to me...

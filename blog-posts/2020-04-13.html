    <h2> Low Effort Recruiter Spam </h2>
    <p> I don't remember when I started getting spam from recruiters, just that nothing good has ever come of it.</p>
    <p>
        I got one this morning where the recruiter managed to misspell my name. You know, the name that's included in
        its entirety in my email address and resume?
    </p>
    <p>
        But no, double-checking that you've spelt someone's name correctly is apparently too much effort. Just send out
        the spam.
    </p>
    <h3> Conclusion </h3>
    <p> Or just send out spam until something sticks, either or. </p>

    <h2> Why <code>iostream</code> is Awful </h2>
    <p>
        Pretty much every piece of <code>iostream</code> is damaged beyond repair. I honestly can't believe people still
        recommend it for IO in C++. (At the very least, it's what's taught in intro C++ courses.) I'm going to just
        assume anyone reading is familiar with <code>iostream</code> and just dive right in.
    </p>
    <h3> Global State </h3>
    <p>
        The first obvious problem is the global state. Whose brain-dead idea was this? Consider the following code:
    </p>
    <p><code>
        cout &lt;&lt; hex &lt;&lt; 0x10 &lt;&lt; endl; <br>
        f(); <br>
        cout &lt;&lt; dec;
    </code></p>
    <p>
        Seems straightforward, but what if <code>f</code> throws an exception? Then we're fucked. Everything is in
        hex because that last line never runs. Or, more realistically, what if we simply forget that last line?
    </p>
    <p> Compare this with <code>printf</code>:</p>
    <p><code>
        printf("%x\n", 0x10); <br>
        f();
    </code></p>
    <p>
        Nice and simple. No possible way to forget to reset to decimal, because <i>there's no global state we have to
        worry about</i>.
    </p>
    <h3> Performance </h3>
    <p>
        Look up some benchmarks of <code>iostream</code> vs. <code>printf</code>. I'll wait. One reason for that?
        Every <code>&lt;&lt;</code> is a <i>separate virtual function call</i>, compared with the single function call
        for <code>printf</code>. And each of those involves syscalls.
    </p>
    <p>
        Syncing <code>iostream</code> with <code>stdio</code> by default obviously doesn't help things, but you'll see
        a performance difference either way.
    </p>
    <p>
        Obviously, IO is normally a bottleneck anyways, so this point is fairly minor compared to some other ones below.
    </p>
    <h3> Bad Syntax </h3>
    <p>
        Say I've got a bitfield and I want to mask it and print the result. With <code>printf</code>, that looks like
        this: <code>printf("%x\n", f & m);</code>. Fairly straightforward. With <code>iostream</code>, we need to do
        this: <code>cout &lt;&lt; hex &lt;&lt; f &amp; m &lt;&lt; endl &lt;&lt; dec;</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Except, wait a minute. That doesn't compile. Why not? Oh, right <code>&lt;&lt;</code> is a bitshift operator as
        well, so it has the wrong precedence compared with <code>&amp;</code>. Oops. Maybe the Java people are right
        about operator overloading.
    </p>
    <h3> Thread Safety </h3>
    <p>
        Under POSIX, any single call to <code>printf</code> is an atomic operation, meaning you'll never have
        output from one thread intermixed with output from another. With <code>iostream</code>, something like
        <code>cout &lt;&lt; "A" &lt;&lt; "B" &lt;&lt; endl;</code> is 3 function calls, and you could get arbitrary
        output from another thread printed in between any of them. Perfect.
    </p>
    <h3> "But <code>printf</code> isn't Type-safe" </h3>
    <p>
        It's $current_year. I've never used a compiler that will let me (a) compile <code>printf</code> with anything
        besides a string literal and (b) compile any type-mismatches in <code>printf</code>. (Yes, this is with
        <code>-Wall -Werror</code>, but if you're not compiling with those already you have bigger problems.) I've
        literally never had a type error from using <code>printf</code>. This is, by far, the weakest excuse for not
        using <code>printf</code> I've ever heard.
    </p>
    <h3> Extensibility </h3>
    <p>
        This is the <i>only</i> advantage of <code>iostream</code> as far as I'm concerned. Just overload
        <code>&lt;&lt;</code> for whatever type you need, boom, custom printing for your type. Quite elegant. Except for
        then you need to use <code>iostream</code>. Dammit.
    </p>
    <p>
        In practice, I've rarely ever actually overloaded <code>&lt;&lt;</code> for custom printing, but that's besides
        the point.
    </p>
    <h3> "So You Want Me to Use <code>printf</code>?" </h3>
    <p>
        Not necessarily. While I would prefer using <code>printf</code> to using <code>iostream</code>, these aren't the
        only options. Lots of libraries support a type-safe and extensible version of <code>printf</code>. C++20 is
        bringing us <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/format">some really nice formatting options</a>.
    </p>
    <h3> Conclusion </h3>
    <p> All I'll say here is that it's pretty telling that most languages have something close to <code>printf</code>,
        but I can't think of a language that copied <code>iostream</code>.

    <h2> Using the C Preprocessor to Template HTML (or: Why I'm Not a Web Developer)</h2>
    <p>
        I'm not a huge fan of web development. I find it fairly uninteresting to move boxes around by a few pixels.
        I'm not particularly good at design either (in case this website didn't give it away).
    </p>
    <p>
        So as a big "fuck you" to all my web dev friends, I've used 0 JavaScript on this website, <em>and</em>, to make
        matters worse, I've templated it using the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_preprocessor">C Preprocessor</a> (<em>cpp</em> for short).
    </p>
    <h3> What Do We Want From an HTML Templater?</h3>
    <p>
        For my purposes, I need the very minimum. Basically, I just want to avoid copy-pasting the same shit all over
        my website. Simple text substitution is all I need.
    </p>
    <p>
        (You'd sure hope that's all I need based on how my website looks.)
    </p>
    <h3>What is cpp?</h3>
    <p>
        cpp is the preprocessor for C and C++ (in case the name didn't give it away). It's the first step of compiling
        a C or C++ program. Basically, anything with <code>#</code> is handled by cpp. cpp copy-pastes any files you
        included with <code>#include</code>, and expands any macros you defined with <code>#define</code>. (I'll get
        into details later, don't worry.)
    </p>
    <p>
        cpp does very basic text substitution, and is almost completely ignorant of C and C++ syntax, save for knowing
        that quotes should be closed. (Which is actually a massive pain in the ass cause I use apostrophes sometimes.)
        It's kind of suitable for templating anything I guess, as long as you're willing to treat that anything
        as random meaningless text. (Which is exactly what I've done for my website.)
    </p>
    <p>
        cpp can also be invoked on its own, without invoking the compiler proper, which is what I've done here. If
        you're using gcc, you can do this with <code>gcc -E filename</code>. I'm fairly sure all C or C++ compilers
        support something similar.
    </p>
    <h3> Why I'm Not a Web Developer </h3>
    <p>
        The nav bar at the top of every page uses the exact same HTML (as it should). Why bother copy-pasting that onto
        each page? Just <code>#include "nav-bar.shtml"</code> and we're done. (This is basically what
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Side_Includes">Server Side Includes</a> are, FYI. Also notice
        that I didn't even bother using the <code>.shtml</code> extension for the right thing.)
    </p>
    <p>
        The date of a blog post shows up multiple times each post. Why bother writing it multiple times? Just do
        <code>#define TODAY 2020-04-02</code> at the top of the file. Perfection.
    </p>
    <p>
        Links to each of my blog posts on <a href="blog.html">my blog</a> are all basically the same format. The only
        thing that varies is the date and title. No problem. Just a quick macro (using some <code>#</code> and
        <code>##</code> fuckery) and we're ready to go.
    </p>
    <p>
        Basically, anything that needs to show up more than once can just be either moved to another file and pasted
        in, or defined as a macro. It's awful but it works. Honestly for what my website is, I don't think using a
        proper tool would even change much.
    </p>
    <h3> Conclusion </h3>
    <p>
        In conclusion, you don't need a real HTML templating language if you don't mind your website looking like shit.

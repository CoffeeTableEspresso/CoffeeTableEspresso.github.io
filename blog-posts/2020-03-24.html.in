        grades.

        The repercussions of this go beyond just the deaths from the virus itself though. Anyone else who gets sick
        while the hospitals are full isn't going to be able to get proper medical attention, which will further add to
        the deaths.

        a good idea now, it's a slippery slope to just constantly tracking everyone. Big Brother is watching.

        On a happier note, PH_LOGO(Stayhome,hub) is offering free premium memberships during the quarantine,
        so that's something.

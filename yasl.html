    <h1> about </h1>
    <p> YASL (Yet Another Scripting Language) is a language i'm currently working on. 
        i'm writing a bytecode interpreter for YASL at the moment, which can be found 
        <a href="https://github.com/CoffeeTableEspresso/YASL"> here </a>. 
        i will write up proper documentation in the future, once either 
        (a) someone harasses me or 
        (b) i feel like it and have some free time. 
    </p>
    <h1> features </h1> 
    <p> currently, YASL supports ints and floats (both 64-bit), and adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing 
        (dividing always returns a float, as that's what you want in almost all cases), negation, and global variables.
    </p>
    <p> in the near future (i.e. once i get some time after co-op job appls), i'll be trying to add booleans, strings,
        (and some basic associated operations), ternary operators, if-(else-)statements, and loops. once that's complete, 
        i'll move on to functions, and eventually more complicated data structures like lists, associative arrays, and classes.
    </p>
    <h1> syntax </h1>
    <p> usual infix notation for operators. </p>
    <p> variables are declared with (e.g.) `var x = 5`. 
        currently, `var` must be used whenever a variable is to change value, but that should be fixed soon 
        (just a few lines extra code in the parser).
    </p>    
    <p> values can be printed using `print value`. </p>

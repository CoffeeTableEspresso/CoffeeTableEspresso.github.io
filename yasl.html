    <h1> about </h1>
    <p> YASL (Yet Another Scripting Language) is a language i'm currently working on. 
        i'm writing a bytecode interpreter for YASL at the moment, which can be found 
        <a href="https://github.com/CoffeeTableEspresso/YASL"> here</a>. 
    </p>
    <h1> types </h1> 
    <p> currently, for numeric types, YASL supports ints (64-bit) and floats (64-bit), and the usual adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing 
        (dividing always returns a float, as that's what you want in almost all cases), negation of the two types, with the 
        expected conversion of ints to floats when using both ints and floats in an expression.
    </p>
    <p> YASL also supports bools, (<code>true</code> and <code>false</code>), as well as a <code>nil</code> value. negation of bools
        can be done with the usual <code>!</code> notation.  YASL also supports <code>and</code> and <code>or</code>, for all types,
        with <code>false</code> and <code>nil</code> being falsey, and everything else being truthy. <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> 
        shortcircuit, and will return either their first or second operand.
    </p>
    <h1> control flow </h1>
    <p> YASL currently has the ternary operator, if-statements, and while-loops for control flow. </p>
    <p> sample if-statement: </p>
    <code>var x = true<br>
          var y = false<br>
          if x and y {<br>
          &nbsp;print 11<br>
          } elseif x {<br>
          &nbsp;print 10<br>
          } elseif y {<br>
          &nbsp;print 1<br>
          } else {<br>
          &nbsp;print 0<br>
          }
    </code>   
    <h1> syntax </h1>
    <p> YASL uses the "usual" infix notation for operators. </p>
    <p> variables are declared with (e.g.) <code>var x = 5</code>. 
        variables are assigned with (e.g.) <code>x = 6</code>.
    </p>    
    <p> values can be printed using <code>print value</code>. </p>
    <h1> blog </h1>
    <p> i'm currently "blogging" (i.e. incoherently vomiting onto a webpage) about writing YASL. i doubt anyone will read it,
        but for completeness' sake i'll include a link here: <a href="blog.html">my "blog"</a>. this is mostly just for my
        future reference, but feel free to read thru.

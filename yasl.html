    <h1> about </h1>
    <p> YASL (Yet Another Scripting Language) is a language i'm currently working on. 
        i'm writing a bytecode interpreter for YASL at the moment, which can be found 
        <a href="https://github.com/CoffeeTableEspresso/YASL"> here</a>. 
        i will write up proper documentation in the future, once either 
        (a) someone harasses me or 
        (b) i feel like it and have some free time. 
    </p>
    <h1> features </h1> 
    <p> currently, YASL supports ints and floats (both 64-bit), and adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing 
        (dividing always returns a float, as that's what you want in almost all cases), negation, and global variables.
    </p>
    <p> in the near future (i.e. once i get some time after co-op job appls), i'll be trying to add booleans, strings,
        (and some basic associated operations), ternary operators, if-(else-)statements, and loops. once that's complete, 
        i'll move on to functions, and eventually more complicated data structures like lists, associative arrays, and classes.
    </p>
    <h1> syntax </h1>
    <p> usual infix notation for operators. </p>
    <p> variables are declared with (e.g.) `var x = 5`. 
        currently, `var` must be used whenever a variable is to change value, but that should be fixed soon 
        (just a few lines extra code in the parser).
    </p>    
    <p> values can be printed using `print value`. </p>
    <h1> 05/01/2018 </h1>
    <p> added nil value. </p>
    <p> i figured out how to do if-statements and while-loops, but i need to implement scopes first. </p>
    <p> i implemented the ternary operator (same as C, unless i f*cked something up), using branch if false
        and unconditional branch. 
    </p>
    <p> i decided that `false` and `nil` are falsey, and everything else is truthy. this
        seems like the cleanest way to do things. i'm not a big fan of the python way of having the trivial instances of 
        everything (empty string, empty list, empty anything, None, false, 0, etc) be falsey. it just feels like too many.
    </p>
    <p> once i figure out scopes i'll add while-loops and if statements. </p>
    <h1> 04/01/2018 </h1>
    <p> added booleans. </p>

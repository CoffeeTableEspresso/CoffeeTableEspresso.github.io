    <h1> About Me </h1>
    <p> I'm a software developer living in <b>Vancouver</b>. I can be found on GitHub as 
      <a href="https://github.com/CoffeeTableEspresso"><b>CoffeeTableEspresso</b></a>. I'm a <b>Combined Honours Mathematics
      &amp; Computer Science</b> student at the <b>University of British Columbia</b>, with an interest in programming language 
      theory and compilers.
    </p>
    <p> I made this website with raw <b>HTML and CSS</b> as a protest against some of the bloated websites we see online 
        today. I tried to make it look vaguely like the standard Ubuntu terminal. Some other programs and tools I like to use: 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> <b>vim</b> &mdash; scriptable text editor </li>
      <li> 
        <b>Azure Pipelines</b> &mdash; continuous integration for GitHub projects. Easy to use with support for Windows,
        Linux, and MacOS. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b> JetBrains IDEs </b> &mdash; my favourite IDEs
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1> Projects </h1> 
    <p> I work on many projects, but my main focus currently is <a href="https://github.com/yasl-lang/yasl"><b>YASL</b></a>,
        a small embeddable scripting language I've built from scratch in pure C99.
    </p>
    <p> I've also managed to compile the YASL interpreter to WASM. The interpreter can be found online
      <a href="https://yasl-lang.github.io/playground/interpreter.html">here</a>, if you'd like to try YASL without 
      downloading anything.
    </p>
    <h1> Blog </h1>
    <p> Here's my blog: <a href="blog.html">blog</a>. </p>
    <h1> My Thoughts on Programming languages </h1>
    <p> Anyone who talks with me knows I criticise almost every programming language I have ever
      used. Here's my thoughts on some languages. Don't @me.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> <b>C</b> &mdash; One of my favourite languages. Portable and low-level. </li>
      <li>
        <b>C++</b> &mdash; Not very well designed but gets the job done when you need need some abstraction on top of C.
      </li>
      <li> <b>Python</b> &mdash; Good general purpose language for scripts and prototypes. </li>
      <li> <b>Julia</b> &mdash; For anything numeric. </li>
      <li> <b>Bash</b> &mdash; For portable shell scripting. (On most platforms at least.) </li>
      <li> <b>Java</b> &mdash; Like C++ but with all the useful parts chopped off. </li>
      <li> <b>JavaScript</b> &mdash; Two words: Stockholm Syndrome. </li>
      <li> <b>TypeScript</b> &mdash; Doesn't really fix JavaScript, but does make it much more bearable.</li>
      <li> <b>Lisp</b> &mdash; You forget about the parentheses surprisingly quickly. </li>
      <li>
        <b>OCaml</b> &mdash; My favourite functinal language. I'd love a chance to use this on a larger project sometime.
      </li>
      <li> <b>Ruby</b> &mdash; Nothing against Ruby, I just don't see a compelling reason to every use it over Python.</li>
      <li> <b>MATLAB</b> &mdash; Please use Julia instead, thanks. Or even Python. </li>
      <li> <b>R</b> &mdash; See my thoughts on MATLAB.</li>
      <li> <b>Go</b> &mdash; The concurrency is just about the only decent part of the language. </li>
    </ul>

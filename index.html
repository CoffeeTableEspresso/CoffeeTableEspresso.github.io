    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p> I'm a software developer living in <b>Vancouver</b>. I can be found on GitHub as 
      <a href="https://github.com/CoffeeTableEspresso"><b>CoffeeTableEspresso</b></a>. I'm a <b>Combined Honours Mathematics
      &amp; Computer Science</b> student at the <b>University of British Columbia</b>, with an interest in programming language
      theory and compilers.
    </p>
    <h2> About This Site </h2>
    <div>
      <blockquote>
        My website's kind of fun for me. I get to do drawings on that. It's kind of fun.

    <p> I made this website with raw <b>HTML and CSS</b> as a protest against some of the bloated websites we see online
      today. I tried to make it look vaguely like the standard Ubuntu terminal. I used the
      <a href="blog-posts/2020-04-02.html"><b>C Preprocessor</b> to template this site</a>, in order to make sure
      no-one ever hires me for a webdev role. (Linkedin version: I used an HtML teMpLAtinG tOoL tO cReAtE mY sTaTic
      WeBsITe.) Also, yes, those are the forbidden <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> tags at
      the top of the page. The <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code> tag is merely deprecated, but I had to animate the
      <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> tag with <b>CSS</b> myself, since modern web browsers have plunged us into a
      <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code>-less dark age.
    </p>
    <h2> Stuff I Like</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> <b>vim</b> &mdash; Scriptable text editor. </li>
      <li>
        <b>Azure Pipelines</b> &mdash; Continuous integration with support for Windows,
        Linux, and MacOS. I use Azure Pipelines to test out <a href="https://github.com/yasl-lang/yasl">YASL</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b> JetBrains IDEs </b> &mdash; My go-to IDEs. I use these whenever they have support for a language I'm using
        (which is most languages I usually use).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Projects </h2>
    <p> I work on many projects, but my main focus currently is <a href="https://github.com/yasl-lang/yasl"><b>YASL</b></a>,
        a small embeddable scripting language I've built from scratch in pure C99.
    </p>
    <p> I've also managed to compile the YASL interpreter to <b>WASM</b>. The interpreter can be found online
      <a href="https://yasl-lang.github.io/playground/interpreter.html">here</a>, if you'd like to try YASL without 
      downloading anything.
    </p>
    <h2> Blog </h2>
    <p> Here's my blog: <a href="blog.html">blog</a>. </p>

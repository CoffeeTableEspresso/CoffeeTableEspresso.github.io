    <h1> About Me </h1>
    <p> I'm a software developer living in <b>Vancouver</b>. I can be found on GitHub as 
      <a href="https://github.com/CoffeeTableEspresso"><b>CoffeeTableEspresso</b></a>. I'm a <b>Combined Honours Mathematics
      &amp; Computer Science</b> student at the <b>University of British Columbia</b>, with an interest in programming language
      theory and compilers.
    </p>
    <h1> About This Site </h1>
    <p> I made this website with raw <b>HTML and CSS</b> as a protest against some of the bloated websites we see online
      today. I tried to make it look vaguely like the standard Ubuntu terminal. I used the <b>C Preprocessor</b> to
        template this site, in order to make sure no-one ever hires me for a webdev role.
        (Linkedin version: I used an HtML teMpLAtinG tOoL tO cReAtE mY sTaTic WeBsITe.)

    <h1> Stuff I Like</h1>
    <ul>
      <li> <b>vim</b> &mdash; Scriptable text editor. </li>
      <li>
        <b>Azure Pipelines</b> &mdash; Continuous integration with support for Windows,
        Linux, and MacOS. I use Azure Pipelines to test out <a href="https://github.com/yasl-lang/yasl">YASL</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b> JetBrains IDEs </b> &mdash; My go-to IDEs. I use these whenever they have support for a language I'm using (
        which is most languages I usually use).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1> Projects </h1>
    <p> I work on many projects, but my main focus currently is <a href="https://github.com/yasl-lang/yasl"><b>YASL</b></a>,
        a small embeddable scripting language I've built from scratch in pure C99.
    </p>
    <p> I've also managed to compile the YASL interpreter to <b>WASM</b>. The interpreter can be found online
      <a href="https://yasl-lang.github.io/playground/interpreter.html">here</a>, if you'd like to try YASL without 
      downloading anything.

    <h1> Blog </h1>
    <p> Here's my blog: <a href="blog.html">blog</a>. </p>
    <h1> My Thoughts on Programming Languages </h1>
    <p> Anyone who talks with me knows I criticise almost every programming language I have ever
      used. <a href="programming-languages.html">Here's my thoughts on some languages.</a> Don't @me.

    <h1> About Me </h1>
    <p> I'm a software developer living in <b>Vancouver</b>. I can be found on GitHub as 
      <a href="https://github.com/CoffeeTableEspresso"><b>CoffeeTableEspresso</b></a>. I'm a <b>Combined Honours Mathematics
      &amp; Computer Science</b> student at the <b>University of British Columbia</b>, with an interest in programming language 
      theory and compilers.
    </p>
    <p> I made this website with raw <b>HTML and CSS</b> as a protest against some of the bloated websites we see online 
        today. I tried to make it look vaguely like the standard Ubuntu terminal. Some other programs and tools I like to use: 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> <b>vim</b> &mdash; scriptable text editor </li>
      <li> 
        <b>Azure Pipelines</b> &mdash; continuous integration for GitHub projects. Easy to use with support for Windows,
        Linux, and MacOS. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <b> JetBrains IDEs </b> &mdash; my favourite IDEs
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1> Projects </h1> 
    <p> I work on many projects, but my main focus currently is <a href="https://github.com/yasl-lang/yasl"><b>YASL</b></a>,
        a small embeddable scripting language I've built from scratch in pure C99.
    </p>
    <p> I've also managed to compile the YASL interpreter to WASM. The interpreter can be found online
      <a href="https://yasl-lang.github.io/playground/interpreter.html">here</a>, if you'd like to try YASL without 
      downloading anything.
    </p>
    <h1> Blog </h1>
    <p> Here's my blog: <a href="blog.html">blog</a>. </p>
    <h1> Languages I Actually Like </h1>
    <p> Anyone who talks with me knows I criticise almost every programming language I have ever
      used. Here's a list of languages (in no particular order) that I actually like:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> <b>C</b> &mdash; portable and low-level</li>
      <li> <b>C++</b> &mdash; not very well designed but gets the job done when you need need some abstraction on top of C</li>
      <li> <b>Python</b> &mdash; good general purpose language for scripts and prototypes</li>
      <li> <b>Julia</b> &mdash; for anything numeric</li>
      <li> <b>Bash</b> &mdash; portable shell scripting </li>
    </ul>
    <h1> Languages I Don't Like </h1>
    <p> For completeness sake he's my (very biased) opinions on some other languages: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> <b>Java</b> &mdash; like C++ but with all the useful parts chopped off </li>
      <li> <b>JavaScript</b> &mdash; two words: Stockholm Syndrome </li>
    </ul>
    <p> Don't @me </p>

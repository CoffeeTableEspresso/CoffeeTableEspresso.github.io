    <h1> About Me </h1>
    <p> I'm a software developer living in <b>Vancouver</b>. I can be found on GitHub as 
      <a href="https://github.com/CoffeeTableEspresso"><b>CoffeeTableEspresso</b></a>. I'm a <b>Combined Honours Mathematics
      &amp; Computer Science</b> student at the <b>University of British Columbia</b>, with an interest in programming language 
      theory and compilers.
    </p>
    <p> I made this website with <b>raw HTML and CSS</b> as a protest against some of the bloated websites we see online 
        today. I tried to make it look vaguely like the standard Ubuntu terminal. Some other programs and tools I like to use: 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> <b>vim</b> &mdash; scriptable text editor </li>
      <li> <b>Travis CI</b> &mdash; continuous integration for GitHub projects.
    </ul>
    <h1> Projects </h1> 
    <p> I work on many projects, but my main focus currently is <a href="https://github.com/yasl-lang/YASL"><b>YASL</b></a>
        a small, embeddable scriptign language I've built from scratch in pure C99.

    <h1> Blog </h1>
    <p> Here's where I vomit words onto the internet: <a href="blog.html">blog</a>. </p>
